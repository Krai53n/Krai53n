## ![(Waving icon)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K4rakara/K4rakara/master/assets/wave.svg) Hi!

I'm a 11 grades  student from Russia. I like make interesting things that help me with work on my PC. Now I'm learning popular language - Python. In future I would like learn and write code on C, C++, Rust, Java, Swift, Python. Beside languages I am trying to learn Gnu/Linux systems. I really like it, exactly ArchLinux, but right now I can't install it and thats why I use Manjaro!


#### Future plans:
    - learn more Python and make interesting things with this language
    - learn how to built architect for programs
    - learn more about vim
    - learn more about Gnu/Linux systems and exacty Arch
    - learm more algorithms, math, geometry, vectors
    - learn sintaxis of C
