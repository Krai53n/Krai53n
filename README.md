## ![(Waving icon)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K4rakara/K4rakara/master/assets/wave.svg) Hi!

I'm a 11 grades  student from Russia. I like make interesting things that help me with work in my PC. Now I'm learning popular language - Python. In future I would like learn and write code on C, C++, Rust, Java, Swift. Beside languages I try learn Gnu/Linux systems. I really like them, exactrly Arch, but right now I can't install him and thats why I use Manjaro!


#### Future plans:
    - learn more about Assembler
    - learn more about C
    - learn more aobut C++
    - learn more about Rust
    - rewrite some projects on Rust and C
    - learn more about Java and Swift for mobile development
    - learn more about bash
    - understand zsh or fish
    - learn more about vim
    - learn more about Gnu/Linux systems and exacty Arch
